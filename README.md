# Frontend-1-Week 2 Project

- Create a Header with a logo positioned on the left side, a search bar in the middle as shown in the UI, and three buttons arranged in a flex box on the right side.

- Create an "About Us" section and include images and text for all three tag lines as shown in the Figma design. Additionally, display a clock and a "Know More" button on the right side. The clock is available as a PNG file that can be exported from Figma and then imported into your design.

- Also create an "Our Categories" section that includes cards as shown in the UI design. Each card should display a category name, a description for that category, and a "Know More" button. The cards should have a rounded border and be arranged in a flexbox with the flex-wrap property enabled.

- Finally, create a footer that matches the UI design. The left side of the footer should include the logo with a description below it. In the middle of the footer display the site map and on the right side display links to socials.
